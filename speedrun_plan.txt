Note started 24/05/21

The start of this project has been pushed more than a little bit.
This is because of all three exams being in the same time period.
So I have a total of 8 days to make this assignment.
Meanwhile I have two other exams which still haven't been completed, but require constant maintainance,
because the deadlines of them are made in chunks.
Thanks a lot =)
