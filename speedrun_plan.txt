Note started 24/05/21

The start of this project has been pushed more than a little bit.
This is because of all three exams being in the same time period,
as well as some other not so minor mandatory assignments.
So I have a total of 8 days to make this exam project.
Meanwhile I have two other exams which still haven't been completed, but require constant maintainance,
because the deadlines of them are made in chunks.
The teachers could've put out the exam definitions a long time ago,
but they decided that us breaking our backs would be much more fun.
Thanks a lot =)
